The experiments from the term paper can be reproduced using the python notebook Term_paper.ipynb. The data used for the experiments in the term paper is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16lYL3DuXq7mDrMNHxrzjPAfUiRo99Tkw?usp=sharing). The original work is available [here](https://github.com/clarkkev/attention-analysis). The data for the experiments was not explicitly provided, however, given raw data, scripts to generate attention maps were provided. For my experiments, I used the attention maps provided as part of the original work [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DEIBQIl0Q0az5ZuLoy4_lYabIfLSKBg-). The best part about these codes is one does not need a GPU enabled system or Google Colab to conduct the experiments in the term paper, they can be run locally on any system using the python notebook. I ran the experiments on both my machine, with Intel 7th Gen Core i3, and Google Colab. It was easier in the latter, but manageable in the former as well.
